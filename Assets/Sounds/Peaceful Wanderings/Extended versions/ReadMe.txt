Hello ^^

Thank you so much for purchasing this audio pack, these are extended versions of the songs made for listening on music platforms, they repeat each loop 2-3 times and then end in a fade out. I hope you enjoy listening and using these songs as much as I enjoyed making them. You are free to use this music in any way you like, no credits in any way, shape or form are necessary. However I would love to see what you make with them, so please drop me a line at rbt.meadow@gmail.com if you do end up using them. Again, thank you so much, I hope our paths cross again and until then, happy art making!!!
